The Smaller Login module presents a small block with a link allowing users to log in or register.

If a user is already logged in, the block doesn’t appear.

This is intended as a more compact replacement for the standard Login block, for sites where most people aren’t expected to have accounts.

The standard block contains user and password fields, and a submit button, and so it is a bit imposing and takes up quite a lot of room in a sidebar.

Requirements
------------

This module has bee tested with the 4.5.x version of Drupal. It probably works with other versions!

Installation
------------


Copy the login.module file to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should automatically detect the module.

Enable the module on the modules administration page.

Enable the Smaller Login block on the blocks administration page.
