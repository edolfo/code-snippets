These scripts are designed to help with managing subtree modules in Git.

To use them you need to install apenwarr's git-subtree support for Git, which you can find here: http://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree

The scripts simplify the process of setting up sub-tree links from one git repository to another, and pulling/pushing between the two.

See http://www.elegantchaos.com/node/454 for a description of why/how you might want to use them, and help on how to do so.

I generally alias the subtree.py script as /usr/local/bin/subtree (without the .py file extension), so that I can just call it from the command line.

Feel free to copy, modify and generally hack these scripts to death. Please let me know about any improvements you make to them!
